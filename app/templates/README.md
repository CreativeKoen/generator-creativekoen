### CreativeKoen Gulp workflow

This is my personal Gulp workflow.

##### Getting Started
You will need
* gulp version 4
* bower
* nodejs

##### Folder scaffolding
You will have a *source* folder with you Preprocessers and your html or php






#### NOTE for myself

`gulp serve` will generate NON minified code in a *build* folder
`gulp build` will generate minified code in a *dist* folder
`gulp deploy` will deploy to ftp/ github gh-pages from the *dist* folder

npm serve -> gulp serve --build
npm build -> gulp build --dist
npm deploy -> gulp deploy
